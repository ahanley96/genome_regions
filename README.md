# Genome Regions Coding Test

There is only one assumption made during this test, and that is that the output files created are to be used further on to display such data in another means. This script is purely used to extract and transform the data into a format that would be used for such displays.

## Running the apps

There are two directories containing python files to run (question1 and question2). The below instructions were created using MacOS, however will run very similarly on Linux.

#### Question 1

```bash
cd question1
python3 genome_regions1.py
```

#### Question 2

```bash
cd question2
python3 genome_regions2.py
```
## Output

Both of the apps will output to the same directory 'output'. Each question will output a .txt file (q1.txt and q2.txt).
